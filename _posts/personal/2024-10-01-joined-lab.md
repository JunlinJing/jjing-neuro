I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the Functional Neuroimaging Lab! This marks an exciting new chapter in my academic journey, where I will be focusing on advanced neuroimaging techniques and their applications in understanding brain function.

The lab's research focuses on:
- Developing novel fMRI analysis methods
- Investigating brain connectivity patterns
- Applying machine learning to neuroimaging data
- Understanding cognitive processes through brain imaging

I look forward to contributing to cutting-edge research in neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience. Stay tuned for updates on our research projects and findings!
