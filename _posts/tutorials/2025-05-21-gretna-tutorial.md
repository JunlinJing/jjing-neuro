## Foreword

Practical open-source tutorials are currently scarce online, and English manuals can be challenging for some. We are committed to the spirit of open source and aim to provide assistance to newcomers, researchers, and practitioners. Thus, this "Brain Science Research Tools Practical Tutorials" series is born. We welcome everyone to follow and engage with us!

## 1. Introduction to GRETNA

GRETNA (Graph Theoretical Network Analysis) is a neuroimaging brain connectivity analysis software developed by Professor Yong He's team at the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University. It is an open-source, MATLAB-based toolbox designed for constructing and analyzing brain networks from neuroimaging data, particularly fMRI.

### 1.1 What is GRETNA?

GRETNA offers a comprehensive framework for applying graph theoretical approaches to brain network analysis. Graph theory provides a mathematical language to describe complex networks, representing brain regions as nodes and their connections (structural or functional) as edges. This approach allows researchers to quantify both local and global topological properties of brain networks, providing insights into brain organization principles.

GRETNA consists of four main modules:
1.  **FC Matrix Construction**: For preprocessing fMRI data and constructing functional connectivity matrices.
2.  **Network Analysis**: For calculating various graph-based network metrics.
3.  **Metric Comparison**: For performing statistical comparisons of network metrics.
4.  **Metric Plotting**: For visualizing network metrics.
A fifth module, **GANMM** (Graph-based Analysis of Network Null Models), allows for assessing network metrics against null models.

### 1.2 Why Use GRETNA for Brain Network Analysis?

Brain connectivity analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to understand the complex organization of the human brain. While several tools exist for network analysis, GRETNA offers several unique advantages:

1. **Integration of Preprocessing and Analysis**: Unlike many tools that require separate preprocessing pipelines, GRETNA integrates preprocessing, network construction, analysis, and visualization within a single platform.

2. **User-Friendly GUI**: GRETNA provides an intuitive graphical user interface that guides users through the various stages of analysis, making advanced network approaches accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience.

3. **Comprehensive Network Metrics**: The toolbox implements a wide range of network measures, from basic centrality metrics to advanced concepts like rich-club organization and modularity.

4. **Statistical Framework**: GRETNA includes built-in statistical methods for comparing network properties across groups or conditions, with appropriate correction for multiple comparisons.

5. **Null Model Generation**: The GANMM module enables rigorous statistical testing by comparing observed network properties against appropriate null models.

### 1.3 GRETNA in the Context of Brain Connectivity Research

Brain connectivity research has evolved significantly over the past two decades, moving from simple correlation analyses to sophisticated network science approaches. GRETNA has been instrumental in this evolution, with applications spanning:

In addition to the GUI, GRETNA provides a comprehensive command-line interface that allows for scripting and batch processing. This is particularly useful for processing large datasets or implementing custom analysis pipelines.

Example of a basic batch script for preprocessing and FC calculation:

```matlab
% Example batch script for processing multiple subjects
subjects = {'sub-01', 'sub-02', 'sub-03', 'sub-04', 'sub-05'};
data_dir = './data';
output_dir = './results';

% Loop through subjects
for i = 1:length(subjects)
    % Define input and output files
    input_file = fullfile(data_dir, subjects{i}, 'func', [subjects{i} '_task-rest_bold.nii']);
    output_file = fullfile(output_dir, 'preprocessed', [subjects{i} '_preprocessed.nii']);
    fc_output = fullfile(output_dir, 'fc_matrices', [subjects{i} '_fc.mat']);
    
    % Preprocessing
    gretna_preprocess(input_file, output_file, ...
                      'SliceTiming', 'Yes', ...
                      'SliceOrder', 'Sequential_Ascending', ...
                      'RefSlice', 'Middle', ...
                      'Realign', 'Yes', ...
                      'Normalize', 'Yes', ...
                      'VoxelSize', [3 3 3], ...
                      'Smooth', 'Yes', ...
                      'FWHM', [6 6 6], ...
                      'Detrend', 'Yes', ...
                      'Filter', 'Yes', ...
                      'Band', [0.01 0.08], ...
                      'Regress', 'Yes', ...
                      'Regressors', {'WM', 'CSF', 'Motion'});
    
    % FC calculation
    atlas_file = './masks/AAL116_mask.nii';
    gretna_FC_roi(output_file, atlas_file, fc_output, 'pearson');
    
    disp(['Completed processing ' subjects{i}]);
end
```

For network analysis:

```matlab
% Example batch script for network analysis
fc_dir = './results/fc_matrices';
output_dir = './results/network_metrics';

% Load all matrices
file_list = dir(fullfile(fc_dir, '*_fc.mat'));
for i = 1:length(file_list)
    load(fullfile(fc_dir, file_list(i).name));
    
    % Calculate global metrics at multiple densities
    densities = 0.1:0.05:0.4;
    for d = 1:length(densities)
        % Small-world parameters
        [Cp(i,d), Lp(i,d), gamma(i,d), lambda(i,d), sigma(i,d)] = ...
            gretna_small_worldness(FC, 'density', densities(d));
        
        % Global efficiency
        Eglob(i,d) = gretna_global_efficiency(FC, 'density', densities(d));
        
        % Modularity
        Q(i,d) = gretna_modularity_und(FC, 'density', densities(d));
    end
    
    % Save results
    save(fullfile(output_dir, 'global_metrics.mat'), 'Cp', 'Lp', 'gamma', 'lambda', 'sigma', 'Eglob', 'Q', 'densities');
end
```

### 3.5 Data Management Strategies

Efficient data management is crucial for successful GRETNA analyses. Here are some recommended practices:

1. **Consistent Directory Structure**:
   ```

   │   ├── raw/             # Original fMRI data
   │   └── preprocessed/    # Preprocessed data
   ├── masks/               # ROI masks and atlases
   ├── fc_matrices/         # Functional connectivity matrices
   ├── network_metrics/     # Calculated network metrics
   │   ├── global/          # Global network properties
   │   └── nodal/           # Nodal network properties
   ├── statistics/          # Statistical results
   ├── plots/               # Visualizations and figures
   └── scripts/             # Analysis scripts
   ```

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use consistent naming patterns (e.g., `sub-XX_task-YY_metric.mat`)
   - Include relevant parameters in filenames (e.g., `nodal_degree_binary_density_0.15.mat`)
   - Avoid spaces and special characters in filenames

3. **Subject Tracking**:
   - Maintain a subject information spreadsheet with demographic details
   - Create text files listing subjects for each analysis or group
   - Document exclusion criteria and excluded subjects

4. **Parameter Documentation**:
   - Save a copy of all analysis parameters for reproducibility
   - Document any deviations from standard protocols
   - Keep a research log of analyses performed and decisions made

Following these strategies will make your analyses more organized, reproducible, and easier to troubleshoot if issues arise.

```

```matlab
% Example for modularity analysis using Louvain algorithm
[community, Q] = modularity_louvain_und(FC);
```

To visualize the modular structure:

```matlab
% Reorder the FC matrix by community
[~, idx] = sort(community);
FC_reordered = FC(idx, idx);
figure; imagesc(FC_reordered); colorbar;
title('FC Matrix Ordered by Community Structure');
```

### 5.2 Dynamic Functional Connectivity

Rather than calculating a single static FC matrix across the entire scan, you can examine how FC changes over time using sliding window analysis:

1. In "FC Matrix Construction", select "Dynamic FC Calculation".
2. Configure:
   - Window length: 30-60 seconds (15-30 TRs)
   - Step size: 2-4 seconds (1-2 TRs)
   - FC measure: Pearson correlation

This will generate multiple FC matrices per subject, one for each time window. You can then:
- Analyze the variability in FC over time
- Identify recurring FC patterns using clustering
- Examine transitions between different FC states

### 5.3 Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Memory Issues**: For whole-brain voxel-wise analyses, you may encounter memory limitations. Consider:
  - Using a parcellation to reduce network size
  - Processing subjects in batches
  - Increasing MATLAB's memory allocation

- **Installation Problems**: If GRETNA fails to launch:
  - Ensure all paths are properly added
  - Check MATLAB version compatibility
  - Verify dependencies (e.g., SPM, if needed)

- **Preprocessing Failures**: If preprocessing steps fail:
  - Examine error messages in the MATLAB console
  - Verify input data format and completeness
  - Check file permissions

- **Thresholding Decisions**: Network metrics can be sensitive to threshold choice. Consider:
  - Analyzing metrics across a range of thresholds
  - Using density-based thresholding for group comparisons
  - Considering alternative approaches like Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

### 5.4 Integration with Other Neuroimaging Tools

GRETNA can be integrated with other neuroimaging tools to create comprehensive analysis pipelines:

1. **Preprocessing with SPM, FSL, or AFNI**:
   - For more specialized preprocessing, use dedicated tools and then import the results into GRETNA for network analysis
   - Example integration with SPM:
     ```matlab
     % After SPM preprocessing
     preprocessed_files = {'sub01_preprocessed.nii', 'sub02_preprocessed.nii'};
     for i = 1:length(preprocessed_files)
         gretna_FC_voxel(preprocessed_files{i}, mask_file, output_files{i});
     end
     ```

2. **Network Visualization with BrainNet Viewer**:
   - Export nodal metrics from GRETNA
   - Use BrainNet Viewer for high-quality visualizations
   - Example code:
     ```matlab
     % After calculating nodal metrics in GRETNA
     load('./results/network_metrics/nodal_degree_binary_density_0.15.mat');
     BrainNet_MapCfg('BrainMesh_ICBM152.nv', 'AAL116.node', nodal_degree, 'betweenness_map.jpg');
     ```

3. **Statistical Analysis with R or Python**:
   - Export GRETNA results as CSV files
   - Perform advanced statistical analyses in R or Python
   - Example MATLAB code for export:
     ```matlab
     % Export network metrics to CSV
     metrics_table = array2table(metrics, 'VariableNames', variable_names, 'RowNames', subject_ids);
     writetable(metrics_table, 'network_metrics.csv', 'WriteRowNames', true);
     ```

### 5.5 Graph Theory Metrics Interpretation

Understanding the neurobiological interpretation of graph metrics is crucial:

1. **Clustering Coefficient**:
   - High values indicate local segregation and specialization
   - May reflect efficient local information processing
   - Typically higher in sensory and motor networks

2. **Path Length and Global Efficiency**:
   - Short path lengths indicate efficient global integration
   - May reflect the capacity for rapid information transfer across brain regions
   - Often associated with cognitive performance measures

3. **Hub Identification**:
   - Hubs are regions with high centrality metrics (degree, betweenness)
   - Often located in association cortices (prefrontal, parietal)
   - May be vulnerable in neurological disorders

4. **Modularity**:
   - High modularity indicates clear community structure
   - Balance between specialization and integration
   - Often changes with development and aging

5. **Small-worldness**:
   - Combination of high clustering and short path lengths
   - Represents efficient network organization
   - May be disrupted in various brain disorders

## 6. Practical Demonstration: A Step-by-Step GRETNA Workshop

In this section, we'll walk through a complete GRETNA analysis using sample data. This demonstration will cover the entire workflow from preprocessing fMRI data to network construction, analysis, and visualization.

### 6.1 Dataset and Preparation

For this tutorial, we'll use a sample dataset consisting of resting-state fMRI data from 20 healthy subjects. Each subject underwent a 10-minute resting-state fMRI scan (TR = 2s, 300 volumes).

First, ensure you have:
1. Downloaded and installed GRETNA (as described in Section 2)
2. Downloaded the sample dataset (available at: [sample dataset link])
3. Set up your directory structure as follows:
   ```
   GRETNA_tutorial/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── sub-01/
   │   │   ├── func/
   │   │   │   └── sub-01_task-rest_bold.nii
   │   ├── sub-02/
   │   ...
   ├── masks/
   │   └── AAL116_mask.nii  # AAL atlas with 116 regions
   ├── results/
   ```

Open MATLAB and navigate to your GRETNA_tutorial directory. Add GRETNA to your path if you haven't already:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('/path/to/GRETNA'));
```

Launch GRETNA by typing:

```matlab
gretna
```

### 6.2 Preprocessing fMRI Data

2. Select "Preprocessing":
   
   For each subject, we'll perform the following preprocessing steps:
   
   - **Slice timing**: Select "Yes" - Important because our TR = 2s
     - Slice order: Sequential ascending
     - Reference slice: Middle slice
   
   - **Realign**: Select "Yes"
     - First volume as reference
   
   - **Normalize**: Select "Yes"
     - Target space: MNI space
     - Voxel size: [3 3 3]
   
   - **Smooth**: Select "Yes"
     - FWHM: [6 6 6]
   
   - **Detrend**: Select "Yes" - Removes linear trends
   
   - **Filter**: Select "Yes"
     - Band-pass: [0.01 0.08] Hz
   
   - **Regress out covariates**: Select "Yes"
     - White matter signal: Yes
     - CSF signal: Yes
     - Global signal: Yes (note: this is debated in the field)
     - Motion parameters: Yes (6 parameters)
     - Scrubbing: Yes (FD threshold = 0.5mm)

3. **Input/Output Configuration**:

   - **Connectivity Measure**:
     - Type: Pearson correlation
   
   - **Input/Output**:
     - Input: Select your preprocessed fMRI data
     - Output: `./results/fc_matrices`

3. Click "Run" to calculate connectivity matrices.

4. Examine a sample matrix to confirm successful calculation:
   
   ```matlab
   % Load and visualize a sample FC matrix
   load('./results/fc_matrices/sub-01_fc.mat');
   figure; imagesc(FC); colorbar; title('FC Matrix - Subject 01');
   ```

   A typical functional connectivity matrix looks like this:
   
   ```

   |         ░░▒▓█          ███▓▒░               |
   |                                              |
   |   ROI-to-ROI Correlations (-1 to 1)         |
   +----------------------------------------------+
   ```
   In this visualization, darker colors represent stronger correlations
   between brain regions, showing the functional connectivity pattern.

## 7. Real-World Case Study: Default Mode Network Analysis

To illustrate the power of GRETNA in real research scenarios, let's examine a case study focusing on the Default Mode Network (DMN) in healthy young adults compared to healthy elderly individuals.

### 7.1 Research Question and Hypothesis

**Research Question**: How does the topology of the Default Mode Network change with normal aging?

**Hypothesis**: With aging, we expect decreased small-worldness and reduced network efficiency in the DMN, alongside changes in the modular organization and hub distribution.

### 7.2 Dataset and Preprocessing

For this case study, we used:
- 30 young adults (18-35 years, mean age = 24.7 ± 4.2)
- 30 elderly adults (60-75 years, mean age = 67.5 ± 3.8)
- 8-minute resting-state fMRI scans (TR = 2s, 240 volumes)
- 3T MRI scanner with standard acquisition parameters

Preprocessing was conducted following the standard pipeline described in Section 6.2:
```matlab
% Example batch script for preprocessing all subjects
subjects = {'sub-01', 'sub-02', ..., 'sub-60'};
for i = 1:length(subjects)
    GRETNAPreprocessing(subjects{i}, ...
                         'SliceTiming', 'Yes', ...
                         'Realign', 'Yes', ...
                         'Normalize', 'Yes', ...
                         'Smooth', 'Yes', ...
                         'Detrend', 'Yes', ...
                         'Filter', [0.01 0.08], ...
                         'Regress', {'WM', 'CSF', 'Global', 'Motion'});
end
```

### 7.3 DMN Definition and Matrix Construction

We defined the DMN using 12 key regions from the AAL atlas:
1. Medial prefrontal cortex (bilateral)
2. Posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (bilateral)
3. Angular gyrus (bilateral)
4. Middle temporal gyrus (bilateral)
5. Superior frontal gyrus, medial (bilateral)
6. Hippocampus (bilateral)

### 7.4 Network Analysis Results

#### 7.4.1 Global Metrics

Analysis of global network metrics revealed:

1. **Small-world properties**: Both groups displayed small-world organization (σ > 1), but the elderly group showed significantly reduced small-worldness (Young: σ = 1.89 ± 0.21, Elderly: σ = 1.64 ± 0.25, p = 0.013).

   ```

2. **Global efficiency**: The elderly group showed decreased global efficiency across all density thresholds (p < 0.01), suggesting reduced information integration capacity.

3. **Modularity**: The elderly group demonstrated higher modularity values (Q = 0.58 ± 0.07) compared to young adults (Q = 0.48 ± 0.08, p = 0.005), indicating more segregated network organization.

Code for calculating and comparing these metrics:

```matlab
% Calculate global metrics for all subjects
for i = 1:length(subjects)
    [Cp(i), Lp(i), lambda(i), gamma(i), sigma(i)] = gretna_small_worldness(FC{i}, 'density', [0.1:0.05:0.4]);
    Eglob(i) = gretna_global_efficiency(FC{i}, 'density', 0.2);
    Q(i) = gretna_modularity_und(FC{i}, 'density', 0.2);
end

% Group comparison
[h, p, ci, stats] = ttest2(sigma(young_idx), sigma(old_idx))
```

#### 7.4.2 Nodal Metrics and Hub Distribution

1. **Hub distribution**: In young adults, the primary hubs were located in the posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. In the elderly group, we observed a shift in hub distribution, with reduced centrality in posterior regions and increased centrality in frontal regions, suggesting a posterior-to-anterior shift with aging.

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

2. **Connectivity strength**: The posterior DMN regions showed decreased connectivity strength in the elderly group, while frontal regions showed preserved or slightly increased connectivity.

Visualization of these differences:

```matlab
% Identify hubs based on degree centrality
for group = 1:2 % 1=young, 2=elderly
    mean_degree = mean(nodal_degree(:,group), 1);
    hubs{group} = find(mean_degree > prctile(mean_degree, 75));
    
    % Visualization using BrainNet Viewer
    BrainNet_MapCfg('BrainMesh_ICBM152.nv', 'DMN_nodes.node', ...
                   mean_degree, sprintf('./results/hubs_group%d.jpg', group));
end
```

### 7.5 Practical Implications

This case study demonstrates several key capabilities of GRETNA:

1. **Focused network analysis**: By extracting just the DMN regions, we performed targeted analysis of a specific functional network of interest.

2. **Age-related changes detection**: GRETNA successfully detected subtle topological changes associated with normal aging, providing insights into how brain networks reorganize over the lifespan.

3. **Multi-level analysis**: By examining both global network properties and region-specific changes, we gained a comprehensive understanding of DMN alterations.

4. **Statistical rigor**: Through appropriate null model comparisons and statistical testing, we ensured the validity of our findings.

The posterior-to-anterior shift in hub distribution aligns with the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA) model of neurocognitive aging. This illustrates how graph theoretical analysis can provide evidence for neuroscience theories and generate new hypotheses.
