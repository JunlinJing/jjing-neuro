# Current State and Future of Brain-Computer Interface Technology

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology has made remarkable progress in recent years, enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices. This post examines current developments and explores future possibilities in this rapidly evolving field.

## Current State of BCI Technology

### Types of BCIs

1. **Invasive BCIs**
   - Intracortical arrays
   - ECoG electrodes
   - Advantages and limitations

2. **Non-invasive BCIs**
   - EEG-based systems
   - fNIRS technology
   - Other emerging methods

### Signal Processing Pipeline

```python
class BCIProcessor:
    def __init__(self, sampling_rate, channels):
        self.sampling_rate = sampling_rate
        self.channels = channels
        self.filters = self._setup_filters()
        
    def _setup_filters(self):
        return {
            'notch': NotchFilter(50, self.sampling_rate),
            'bandpass': BandpassFilter(0.5, 50, self.sampling_rate)
        }
        
    def process_signal(self, raw_signal):
        filtered = self._apply_filters(raw_signal)
        features = self.extract_features(filtered)
        return self.classify(features)
```

        self.temporal = nn.LSTM(32, hidden_size, bidirectional=True)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_size*2, num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.spatial(x)
        x, _ = self.temporal(x)
        return self.classifier(x)
