### 4. The Expanding Horizon

The boundaries of neuroscience are continually expanding, with new subfields emerging at the intersection of brain science and other disciplines. Fields like **neuroarchitecture** (the impact of built environments on the brain), **neuromarketing** (neural basis of consumer behavior), and **neuroethics** (ethical issues in brain research and neurotechnology) are gaining traction.
