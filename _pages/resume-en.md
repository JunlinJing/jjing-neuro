# Research Experience

## Current Research Project | 2024-Present
**Department of Radiology,, LMU**
- Project in Progress


## Previous Research Project | 2021-2024
**Brain connectivity lab, UESTC**
1. **Brain age prediction based on spatial characteristics of autism patients**
- This project investigated two blind source separation methods, GIG-ICA and IVA-GL, to assess their effectiveness in extracting unique spatial properties of the brain. The resting-state image data underwent preprocessing (including outlier removal, level correction, etc.). Spatial components were then extracted and matched with prior templates, and time series were used to calculate static functional connectivity. Additionally, community detection was applied to determine network modularity, and statistical tests were conducted for feature selection. Finally, the LASSO model was utilized to predict age differences. The results demonstrated that both methods had complementary effects on functional connectivity-related indicators. Overall, the two methods have their own strength and weakness.
2. **Research on resting state classification based on spatiotemporal characteristics of Alzheimer's disease**
- This project compared the classification accuracy of GICA, GIG-ICA, and IVA-GL with inter-subject variability by using their extracted temporal and spatial features. The participants' resting state image data was preprocessed and matched with prior templates for spatiotemporal feature extraction. A custom Adaptive PCA method was used to maximize effective dependence information. Pearson linear correlation was used for calculating inter-test variability, and finally, an SVM model calculated the classification accuracy. Results showed that smaller within-group variability generally led to higher classification accuracy.  
3. **Functional and structural division of the brains of cocaine addicts based on K-means clustering method**
- The project aims to determine the overlap of reward circuits in patients' brains through DTI and MRI data for causal and genetic analysis. Preprocessed MRI data was used to calculate functional connections, segmenting brain gray and white matter using K-means clustering. The overlap was then analyzed separately using Gran causality and meta-analysis. Current findings indicate some overlap in Functional connectivity.
