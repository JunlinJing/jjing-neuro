# About Me

I am a neuroscience researcher passionate about understanding the brain and developing intelligent systems. My research experience primarily focuses on neuroimaging and machine learning applications in neurological and psychiatric disorders. I have led three major projects as the first author, examining neurofunctional patterns, predictive modeling, and classification in clinical populations.

## Research Experience

### Brain Age Prediction in Autism
This project investigates how spatial characteristics of autism patients influence brain age prediction. By analyzing distinct spatial components extracted from neuroimaging data, we aimed to determine patterns associated with atypical neurodevelopment. The study revealed that different blind source separation methods provided complementary insights into functional connectivity, contributing to a more accurate age prediction model. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging spatial brain patterns for early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

### Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Using Resting-State Spatiotemporal Features
This research focuses on improving classification models for Alzheimer's disease by examining inter-subject variability in functional connectivity. By integrating novel feature extraction techniques, we evaluated the impact of spatial and temporal characteristics on classification accuracy. Our findings suggest that reducing within-group variability enhances classification performance, offering promising directions for refining diagnostic models and understanding neurodegenerative progression.

### Functional and Structural Brain Division in Cocaine Addiction
This project explores how functional and structural brain alterations in cocaine addicts relate to reward circuitry dysfunction. Through clustering-based analysis, we identified distinct segmentation patterns in gray and white matter regions. The study provided evidence of overlapping functional connectivity patterns, contributing to a better understanding of addiction-related neural mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
