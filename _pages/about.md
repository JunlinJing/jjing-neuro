# About Me

I am a neuroscience researcher focusing on brain functional network analysis and neuroimaging. Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Functional Neuroimaging at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, I combine computational methods with neuroimaging techniques to understand brain connectivity patterns and their alterations in various conditions.
