<div class="research-intro">
My research focuses on machine learning applications in neuroimaging analysis, particularly in the investigation of functional brain connectivity patterns in neurological and psychiatric disorders. I combine advanced computational methods with resting-state functional MRI data to develop novel approaches for personalized diagnosis and treatment evaluation. This work is situated at the intersection of neuroscience, computer science, and clinical medicine, with the goal of advancing our understanding of brain function in health and disease.

<h3 class="project-title">Use of Machine Learning for Investigation of Deviant Functional Connectome</h3>

<div class="project-description">
In recent years, Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fcMRI) has become a valuable tool for understanding how different parts of the human brain communicate with each other. This project investigates the application of advanced machine learning techniques to identify and characterize abnormal connectivity patterns that may serve as biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric conditions.
