# Research

My research focuses on machine learning applications in neuroimaging analysis, particularly in the investigation of functional brain connectivity patterns in neurological and psychiatric disorders. I combine advanced computational methods with resting-state functional MRI data to develop novel approaches for personalized diagnosis and treatment evaluation.

## Current Projects

### Use of Machine Learning for Investigation of Deviant Functional Connectome

In recent years, Intrinsic Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fcMRI) has become a valuable tool for understanding how different parts of the human brain communicate with each other. This project investigates:

- Analysis of resting-state functional MRI scans for brain connectivity mapping
- Development of machine learning approaches for detecting abnormal connectivity patterns
- Investigation of disease-specific network alterations in neurological and psychiatric disorders
- Implementation of personalized diagnostic tools based on connectivity biomarkers

### Clinical Applications of Brain Connectivity Analysis

Translating neuroimaging research into clinical practice through:
- Development of automated analysis pipelines for clinical fcMRI data
- Investigation of tumor-related changes in brain connectivity
- Assessment of whole-brain connectivity alterations in various pathological conditions
- Validation of connectivity-based biomarkers for disease progression

### Advanced Methods in Neuroimaging Analysis

Developing and implementing cutting-edge approaches for:
- Improved preprocessing and artifact removal in fMRI data
- Novel machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition in brain connectivity
- Integration of multiple imaging modalities
- Robust statistical frameworks for clinical applications
