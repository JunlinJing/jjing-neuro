# Research

My research focuses on understanding the computational principles of brain function and developing brain-inspired artificial intelligence systems. I combine theoretical approaches with experimental data analysis to bridge the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

## Current Projects

### Neural Mechanisms of Adaptive Learning

Understanding how the brain adapts to changing environments is crucial for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. This project investigates:
- Neural signatures of prediction errors and surprise
- Computational models of metacognition and learning
- Applications to artificial neural networks

### Brain-Computer Interface Development

Developing next-generation brain-computer interfaces that are more intuitive and adaptive:
- Real-time neural decoding algorithms
- Adaptive calibration methods
- User-centered interface design
- Applications in assistive technology

### Cognitive Architecture Modeling
